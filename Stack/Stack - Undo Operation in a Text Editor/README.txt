In modern text editors, when users type text, they often need to reverse their actions, like performing an undo operation. This scenario demonstrates how we can simulate this functionality by reversing a string using a stack. The stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, making it ideal for tasks such as reversing the order of elements or undoing the most recent actions.

We will build a program where:

The user types a sentence.
The program simulates the undo operation by reversing the text using a stack.
Input Format

The user will enter a single line of text (a sentence) that they have "typed" in the text editor.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

The program will display the reversed version of the input sentence, simulating the result of an undo operation.

Sample Input 0

Welcome to the coding world
Sample Output 0

dlrow gnidoc eht ot emocleW
Explanation 0

The user types the sentence "Welcome to the coding world". The program pushes each character of the string onto a stack: W, e, l, c, o, m, e, , t, o, , t, h, e, , c, o, d, i, n, g, , w, o, r, l, d.

Using the LIFO principle, when the program pops each character from the stack, it retrieves the characters in reverse order.

The output shows the sentence reversed: dlrow gnidoc eht ot emocleW.
